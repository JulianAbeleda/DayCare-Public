# main plus the apparatus, exp is dev plus experimentation. So the trunk must
# flow OUTWARD or the outer branches stop being supersets and become forks.

# The one case that needs a human: when the trunk PRUNES something the outer
# branches retain. The merge will delete it there too, which is the opposite of
# what the layout is for. This script does not guess — it merges, then reports
# exactly what each merge deleted, and stops so the deletions can be restored as
# an apparatus commit if they should be.
